MovieLibs
========================

Description
------------------------
MovieLibs is a project created by myself and [mtwstudios](https://github.com/mtwstudios) for the [TimesOpen 2012 Hack Day](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/timesopen-2012-hack-day-wrap-up/).

To see the final results of the project please visit the project's [tumblr blog](http://movielibs.tumblr.com)

MovieLibs allows a user to search for a movie by keyword, and turns the movie's plot into an interactive [Mad Lib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madlibs).

After creating the Mad Lib, the user is presented with a new, humorous movie plot accompanied by a photo from Tumblr which can then be posted as a blog entry.
